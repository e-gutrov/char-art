# Char Art Script
This script will work well only with highly-contrasted images.

All you need to do is just put main.py and chars.json in the same dir. Then:
* Run main.py
* Enter an absolute path to image. Tested extensions: jpg, png. But you can try others.
* Enter an absolute or relative path to output file. If the file does not exist, it will be created.
* Brightness of chars depends on background and font colors. So you will be asked if you want output file created 
for bright font and dark background or you want to have output
 that looks good on bright background with dark font.
* Open result with any text editor. For better effect keep scrolling up and down.
